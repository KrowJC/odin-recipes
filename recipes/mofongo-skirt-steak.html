        <h2>Introduction & History</h2>
            <p>Green plantain, pork cracklings chicharrón, garlic, 
               and salt is all you need to make mofongo. However, there is,
               thankfully, more than one way to make it. Often, olive oil or 
               chicken broth is added to moisten the mixture a bit, and 
               sometimes a ripe plantain is used instead of a green one, while
               the use of either cassava, taro, eddoe, breadfruit, or a mixture
               of plantains and cassava instead of plantains is also quite widespread. 
               Also, mofongo can have a seafood or a meat filling — alternatively, 
               these can be just poured over a mofongo — in which case we are talking
               of mofongo relleno. The preparation starts with frying the plantain 
               slices until golden, then mashing them in a pilón, a special mortar 
               from Puerto Rico. Once mashed a bit, garlic, pork cracklings,
               and salt are added, and the mixture is mashed some more until well combined.
               The mixture is then shaped into a dome and typically served with fried meat 
               on top and broth soup on the side.</p>

            <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>
               <h3><Strong>Method</Strong></h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li>When frying the plantains, the temperature should never be 
                        above 350°F as the plantains need to cook throughout.</li>
                    <li>They should also be fried only until lightly golden
                        otherwise they will be too dry to mash.</li>
                    <li>For mashing the plantains, if you do not own a pilón, you can 
                        use a potato masher instead.</li>
                    <li>The garlic should be pounded to a paste before it's added
                        to the plantains, unlike mofongo which should never be completely
                        be mashed into a paste.</li>
                    <li>A bit of broth or olive oil can be added as well to help moisten 
                        the mixture a bit if necessary.</li>
                  </ol> 
                <h3><strong>Serving</strong></h3>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Serve with fried meat and broth on the side.</li>
                    <li>You can also serve it with salsa criolla, a Puerto Rican tomato, 
                        onion, peppers, and garlic sauce.</li>
                   </ol>
