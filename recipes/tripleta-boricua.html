The Puerto Rican Tripleta sandwich is the ultimate culmination of history, heritage and flavor. As an island in the Carribean, Puerto Rico is at a culinary crossroads, with flavor influences from Spain and even West Africa to create a “La Cocina Criolla,” or “creole” cuisine of its own.</p>

            </ul>

        <h2>Coocking Tips</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season chicken and pork with salt, pepper, cumin, parsley, olive oil and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and chill in the fridge for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Heat an electric skillet to 350ºF and cook the chicken and pork until fully cooked. It should take around 10 to 15 minutes, flipping halfway through (the internal temperature should be 165°F or chicken and 145°F for pork). Alternatively, you can fry the chicken and pork in a frying pan on the stove, over medium heat.</li>
