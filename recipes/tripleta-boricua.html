       <h2>Introduction & History</h2>
           <p>A Puerto Rican twist on a cubano sandwich, the Triplet 
              is piled high with meat. Three kinds of meat to be exact, 
              including grilled steak, lechon pork, and ham, hence Its name: 
              Tripleta. The Puerto Rican Tripleta sandwich is the ultimate 
              culmination of history, heritage and flavor.</p>

               Tripleta sandwich is the ultimate culmination of history, heritage 
               and flavor. As an island in the Carribean, Puerto Rico is at a culinary 
               crossroads, with flavor influences from Spain and even West Africa to 
               create a “La Cocina Criolla,” or “creole” cuisine of its own.</p>
